1.  stdint.h is a c programming library that provides you with the flexibility of managing the size of your data types

2.  to manage the exact size of a data you want for example, a byte has 256 values so we assign it the uint8_t data type which,
    coincidentally, although most likely not, can store up to 256 values.

3.  uint8_t = 1 byte, uint16_t = 2 bytes, unint32_t and int32_t both = 4 bytes.

4.  The first two bytes of a BMP file needs to correspond to the letters BM, which,
    in hexadecimal is the equivalent of 42(66) and 4d(73)

5.  bfsize is the size of the BMP and bisize is the size of its structure

6.  A negative bitheight value indicates that the bitmap is top-down with the originating corner being the top-left.
    A positive value indicates that the BMP is bottom-up

7.  In the BITMAPINFOHEADER struct, the biBitCount field specifies the BMP color depth(amount of bits per pixel)

8.  fopen may return NULL on line 24 and 32 in copy.c if the pointer points to null, that is, if memory is not set for the pointer

9.  The third arugment in fread is equal to zero becuase we only want to read it once

10. if bi.width is 3 then the assigned padding value is 1

11. fseek sets the file position given an offset

12. SEEK_CUR in fseek sets the file position by the given offset from its current position of the file pointer
    while SEEK_SET is beggining of the file and SEEK_END is the end of the file
